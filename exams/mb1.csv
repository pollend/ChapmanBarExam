The bartender had opened other bottles of champagne, and occasionally the stoppers had shot out with great force, but the bartender had not been injured. The bartender has brought an action against the winery, alleging that the bottle that caused his injury was defective and unreasonably dangerous because its label did not warn that the stopper might suddenly shoot out during opening.

d,"Constitutional Law,  Powers","An interstate bus company operates in a five-state area. A federal statute authorizes the Interstate Commerce Commission (ICC) to permit interstate carriers to discontinue entirely any unprofitable route.

A man is the owner of a mountain resort in the mountain range, whose customers usually arrived on vehicles operated by the bus company. After exhausting all available federal administrative remedies, the man filed suit against the bus company in the trial court of the state in which the mountain range is located to enjoin the discontinuance by the bus company of its service to that area. The man alleged that the discontinuance of service by the bus company would violate a statute of that state prohibiting common carriers of persons from abandoning service to communities having no alternate form of public transportation. The state court should:","dismiss the action, because the man lacks standing to sue.","direct the removal of the case to federal court, because this suit involves a substantial federal question.","hear the case on its merits and decide for the man because, on these facts, a federal agency is interfering with essential state functions.","hear the case on its merits and decide for the bus company, because a valid federal law preempts the state statute on which the man relies.",,,

b,"Constitutional Law,  Powers","A federal statute prohibits the construction of nuclear energy plants in this country without a license from the Federal Nuclear Plant Siting Commission. The statute provides that the Commission may issue a license authorizing the construction of a proposed nuclear energy plant 30 days after the Commission makes a finding that the plant will comply with specified standards of safety, technological and commercial feasibility, and public convenience. In a severable provision, the Commission's enabling statute also provides that the Congress, by simple majorities in each house, may veto the issuance of a particular license by the Commission if such a veto occurs within 30 days following the required Commission finding. Early last year, the Commission found that a company met all statutory requirements and, therefore, voted to issue the company a license authorizing it to construct a nuclear energy plant. Because they believed that the issuance of a license the company was not in accord with the applicable statutory criteria, a majority of each of the two houses of Congress voted, within the specified 30-day period, to veto the license. On the basis of that veto, the Commission refused to issue the license. Subsequently, the company sued the Commission in an appropriate federal district court, challenging the constitutionality of the Commission's refusal to issue the license. In this suit, the court should hold the congressional veto of the license of the company to be:","invalid, because any determination by Congress that particular agency action does not satisfy statutory criteria violates Article III, Section 1 of the Constitution because it constitutes the performance of a judicial function by the legislative branch.","invalid, because Article I, Section 7 of the Constitution has been interpreted to mean that any action of Congress purporting to alter the legal rights of persons outside of the legislative branch must be presented to the President for his signature or veto.","valid, because Congress has authority under the commerce clause to regulate the construction of nuclear energy plants.","valid, because there is a compelling national interest in the close congressional supervision of nuclear plant siting in light of the grave dangers to the public health and safety that are associated with the operation of such plants.",,,

c,"Constitutional Law,  Individual Rights","Public schools in a State are financed, in large part, by revenue derived from real estate taxes imposed by each school district on the taxable real property located in that district. Public schools also receive other revenue from private gifts, federal grants, student fees, and local sales taxes. For many years, State has distributed additional funds, which come from the state treasury, to local school districts in order to equalize the funds available on a per-student basis for each public school district. These additional funds are distributed on the basis of a state statutory formula that considers only the number of students in each public school district and the real estate tax revenue raised by that district. The formula does not consider other revenue received by a school district from different sources. The school boards of two school districts, together with parents and schoolchildren in those districts, bring suit in federal court to enjoin the state from allocating the additional funds from the state treasury to individual districts pursuant to this formula. They allege that the failure of the State, in allocating this additional money, to take into account a school district's sources of revenue other than revenue derived from taxes levied on real estate located there violates the equal protection clause of the Fourteenth Amendment. The complaint does not allege that the allocation of the additional state funds based on the current statutory formula has resulted in a failure to provide minimally adequate education to any child.

The retailer seeks to introduce evidence that during the three years of the agreement it had returned, for various reasons, 125 undefective radios, for which the manufacturer had granted full credit.

a,"Constitutional Law,  Powers","A man contracted with an interstate carrier, to ship household goods across country to his new home in a State. A federal statute provides that all liability of an interstate mover to a shipper for loss of or damage to the shipper's goods in transit is governed exclusively by the contract between them. The statute also requires the mover to offer a shipper at least two contracts with different levels of liability. In full compliance with that federal statute, the carrier offered the man a choice between two shipping agreements that provided different levels of liability on the part of the carrier. The more expensive contract provided that the carrier was fully liable in case of loss or damage. The less expensive contract limited the carrier's liability in case of loss or damage to less than full value. The man voluntarily signed the less expensive contract with the carrier, fixing the carrier's liability at less than the full value of the shipment.The carrier's truck was involved in an accident in the State. The accident was entirely a product of the negligence of the carrier's driver. The man's household goods were totally destroyed. In accordance with the contract, the carrier reimbursed the man for less than the full value of the goods. The man then brought suit against the carrier under the tort law of the State claiming that he was entitled to be reimbursed for the full value of the goods. The carrier filed a motion to dismiss.In this suit, the court should:","dismiss the case, because the federal statute governing liability of interstate carriers is the supreme law of the land and preempts state tort law.","dismiss the case, because the contractual relationship between the man and the carrier is governed by the obligation of contracts clause of the Constitution.","deny the motion to dismiss, because the full faith and credit clause of the Constitution requires that state tort law be given effect.","deny the motion to dismiss, because it is unconstitutional for a federal statute to authorize the carrier to contract out of any degree of liability for its own negligence.",,,

It further showed, however, that the owner had been out of the country when the meat was sold and had had no reason to know that any of the meat was contaminated.The jury convicted the owner, and the court sentenced him to a large fine and probation.

b,"Constitutional Law,  Individual Rights","City operates a cemetery pursuant to a city ordinance.

The ordinance further provides that the purchase of a cemetery lot entitles the owner to perpetual care of the lot, and entitles the owner to erect on the lot, at the owner's expense, a memorial monument or marker of the owner's choice, subject to certain size restrictions. The City ordinance requires the city to maintain the cemetery, including mowing the grass, watering flowers, and plowing snow, and provides for the expenditure of city tax funds for such maintenance if revenues from the sale of cemetery lots are insufficient. Although cemetery lots are sold at full fair market value, which includes the current value of perpetual care, the revenue from the sale of such lots has been insufficient in recent years to maintain the cemetery. As a result, a small amount of city tax funds has also been used for that purpose.A group of City taxpayers brings suit against City challenging the constitutionality of the city ordinance insofar as it permits the owner of a cemetery lot to erect a religious memorial monument or marker on his or her lot.Is this suit likely to be successful?","No, because only a small amount of city tax funds has been used to maintain the cemetery.","No, because the purpose of the ordinance is entirely secular, its primary effect neither advances nor inhibits religion, and it does not foster an excessive government entanglement with religion.","Yes, because city maintenance of any religious object is a violation of the establishment clause of the First Amendment as incorporated into the Fourteenth Amendment.","Yes, because no compelling governmental interest justifies authorizing private persons to erect religious monuments or markers in a city-operated cemetery.",,,
