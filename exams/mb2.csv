The employee claims to have suffered the distress as a consequence of learning that she has been exposed for five years, while employed by the appliance repair shop at the premises affected by the EPA order, to the toxic contamination that has existed there. Her complaint does not allege that her emotional distress is severe, that the manufacturer’s conduct was extreme and outrageous, or that she has suffered any physical consequences.

The disclosure that the businessman was in New Orleans and not in Chicago at the time resulted in the loss of his position with his company and great humiliation and embarrassment for him. If the businessman asserts a claim against the television stations for broadcasting his picture as he disembarked, is he likely to prevail?","Yes, because the businessman’s location was revealed against his wishes.","Yes, because publication of the television pictures caused the businessman pecuniary loss.","No, because the humiliation and embarrassment did not result in physical harm to the businessman.",The no-alcohol term would be interpreted as a promise and not a condition.

When the developer saw the preliminary plans, the developer told the architect that the concept was impressive and that he looked forward to seeing the final plans. The architect continued to have several alcoholic drinks each day and completed the plans within the specified contract period. However, the developer declined to review, accept, or pay for the final plans and stated that it was because of the architect's continued use of alcohol. The architect has sued the developer for breach of contract. Which of the following arguments best supports the architect's claim?","The alcohol use was not a material breach of contract by the architect, since it did not affect the quality of the work.",The developer waived the condition of no alcohol use.,The no-alcohol term was functionally a penalty clause and therefore was unenforceable.,"Yes, because the buyer's promise to pay $2, to the creditor revived the uncollectible debt."

The driver argued that the officer had elicited the statement without providing the requisite Miranda warnings.

The man’s family then rented an apartment and demanded that the city pay the rent for that temporary residence. The family relied on a state law providing that any person who was dispossessed of his or her place of residence because of the actions of city officials was entitled to replacement housing at the city’s expense until permanent substitute housing could be found. When the city refused to pay the rent for the apartment, the man’s family sued the city in a state trial court claiming a right to such payment under both the state law and the due process clause of the Fourteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution. The highest state court ruled for the family. Although the court decided that the family had no right to payment under the state law, it held that the Fourteenth Amendment entitled the family to payment of the rent for the temporary apartment. In its opinion, the highest state court indicated that in several of its decisions it had found cities liable for compensation in similar situations on the basis of the due process clause of the state constitution. But the highest state court declined to base its holding on the state constitution because that issue had not been properly raised in the case. The city then filed a petition for a writ of certiorari in the United States Supreme Court. Does the Court have jurisdiction to review the merits of this case?","Yes, because the highest state court based its decision wholly on federal law grounds.","Yes, because the federal and state law issues in this case are so intertwined that a resolution of the federal law issues is necessary to facilitate a proper determination of the state law issues.","No, because the decision of the highest state court renders the case moot.","Yes, because the operation of a licensed barbershop is a privilege and, therefore, is subject to any reasonable restriction imposed by the state."

When the woman's daughter returned a few days later, the ambulance service picked up the woman from the nursing home and returned her to the daughter's house. The daughter was shocked to discover that the woman had a broken leg; her leg had been uninjured when she left for the nursing home. A physician's report attached to the complaint stated that the woman's leg injury would not have occurred in the absence of negligence. The complaint further alleged that the woman was under the control, successively, of the ambulance service and the nursing home during the time when she must have sustained the injury, and that either the ambulance service or the nursing home must have negligently moved or handled the woman, causing the injury to her leg. Both defendants have argued that the allegations in the complaint are inadequate to support a negligence claim.

When the second man moved in, the man brought an appropriate action against the landlord, the woman, and the second man for a declaratory judgment that the woman had no right to assign. The woman’s defense was that she and the man were tenants in common of a term for years, and that she had a right to assign a fractional interest in her undivided one- half interest.

The pharmacist established and operated a drugstore at the leased premises. The lease included provisions that described the shopping center by metes and bounds; identified the entrances, parking areas, signs, and other common facilities of the shopping center; and set out a covenant that the owner would not lease any part of the shopping center to another drugstore. Last year the owner purchased a parcel of land immediately adjacent to the shopping center. That parcel was improved with a building that, at the time of the owner’s purchase and for ten years earlier, was occupied in part by a food supermarket and in part by a discount drugstore, under leases which the prior owner assigned to the owner. The owner reconstructed the common facilities of both shopping centers to integrate them and combine them so that, to the public, the two centers appeared as a larger single development. The pharmacist learned that the lease of the discount drugstore was about to expire and that the owner planned to enter into a new lease of the same space with the discount drugstore. The pharmacist protested the proposed new lease, but the owner declared his intention to go forward with it. The pharmacist brought an appropriate action to enjoin the new lease to the discount drugstore as a violation of the covenant in the pharmacist’s lease. If the court finds for the owner, what will be the likely reason?",The covenant in the pharmacist’s lease can be fairly construed as to apply only to the original shopping center premises.,A covenant cannot restrict the use of land not owned by the covenantor when the covenant was created.,A covenant that attempts to restrict competition is invalid as against public policy even if it runs with the land.,nan
