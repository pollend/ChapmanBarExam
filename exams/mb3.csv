On August 20, the company tendered the cabinets to the customer, who refused to accept or pay for them on the ground that they were not tendered on August 15, even though they otherwise met the contract specifications. Assuming that all appropriate defenses are seasonably raised, will the company succeed in an action against the customer for breach of contract?","Yes, because neither the July 15 agreement nor the August 1 agreement was required to be in writing.","Yes, because the August 1 agreement operated as a waiver of the August 15 delivery term.","No, because there was no consideration to support the August 1 agreement.","No, because the parol evidence rule will prevent proof of the August 1 agreement."

The seller told the buyer that the boat was seaworthy and had never sustained any significant damage. In fact, the hull of the boat had been badly damaged when the seller had run the boat aground. The seller had then done a cosmetic repair to the hull rather than a structural repair. The buyer relied on the seller's representations and paid a fair price for a boat in good repair, only to discover after the sale was completed that the hull was in fact badly damaged and in a dangerous condition. The seller has refused to refund any of the buyer's money, and the buyer is contemplating suing the seller. Under what theory would the buyer be most likely to recover?",Fraud.,Intentional endangerment.,Negligent misrepresentation.,Strict products liability.

The case was tried to the court solely on documentary evidence. Immediately after the close of the evidence, the judge announced from the bench, ""Judgment shall be entered for the manufacturer,"" and judgment was so entered. The buyer has appealed the judgment. What is the buyer's best argument for persuading the appellate court to reverse the judgment?",The judgment is clearly erroneous because it was based solely on documentary evidence.,The manufacturer was required to file proposed findings and conclusions before the trial court ruled.,The trial court erred because it announced the judgment without giving the parties an opportunity to submit proposed findings and conclusions.,The trial court erred by not providing findings and conclusions.

The attorney refuses to produce the letter on the ground of privilege. Production of the letter should be","prohibited, because the statement is protected by the attorney-client privilege.","prohibited, because the statement is protected by the client's privilege against self- incrimination","required, because the statement was in furtherance of crime or fraud.","required, because the attorney-client privilege belongs to the client and can be claimed only by her."

The man should be:","acquitted, because he used no threats and was intoxicated.","acquitted, because his mistake negated the required specific intent.","convicted, because his intoxication was voluntary.","convicted, because mistake is no defense to robbery."
c,"Constitutional Law, Individual Rights,",A state initiated a criminal prosecution against the owner of a video store for selling a video that consisted entirely of pictures of nude sunbathers on a beach in a foreign country where nude public sunbathing is common. The state charged that selling the video violated its anti-obscenity law. The store owner defended on the ground that the prosecution violated his constitutional right to freedom of speech. Should the store owner prevail in this defense?,"No, because the store owner is engaged in the commercial sale of the video, which is not protected by the First and Fourteenth Amendments.","No, because the video consists entirely of portrayals of nudity, appeals to the prurient interest of viewers, and lacks serious social value as a whole.","Yes, because mere portrayals of nudity are insufficient to justify a finding that the video is obscene as a matter of constitutional law.","Yes, because the portrayals of nudity occurred outside the United States, and therefore the state lacks a compelling interest in applying its anti-obscenity law to the sale of the video."

The customer unjustifiably repudiated on February 1. Without notifying the customer, the company subsequently sold at private sale the same specific computer to another person, who paid the same price ($3,000) in cash. The ICB is a popular product. The company can buy from the manufacturer more units than it can sell at retail.

d,"Real Property, Easements, Covenants and Servitudes,","A woman owned land, which was improved with a dwelling. A neighbor owned an adjoining unimproved lot suitable for constructing a dwelling. The neighbor executed and delivered a deed granting the woman an easement over the westerly 15 feet of his unimproved lot for convenient ingress and egress to a public street, although the woman's lot abuts another public street. The woman did not then record the neighbor's deed. After the woman constructed and started using a driveway within the described 15-foot strip in a clearly visible manner, the neighbor borrowed $10,000 cash from a bank and gave the bank a mortgage on his unimproved lot. The mortgage was promptly and properly recorded. The woman then recorded the neighbor's deed granting her the easement. The neighbor subsequently defaulted on his loan payments to the bank. The recording act of the jurisdiction provides: ""No conveyance or mortgage of real property shall be good against subsequent purchasers for value and without notice unless the same be recorded according to law."" In an appropriate foreclosure action as to the neighbor's unimproved lot, brought against the woman and the neighbor, the bank seeks, among other things, to have the woman's easement declared subordinate to the bank's mortgage, so that the easement will be terminated by completion of the foreclosure. If the woman's easement is NOT terminated, it will be because",the recording of the deed granting the easement prior to the foreclosure action protects the woman's rights.,the easement provides access from the woman's land to a public street.,the woman's easement is appurtenant to her land and thus cannot be separated from her land.,visible use of the easement by the woman put the bank on notice of the easement.
a,"Real Property, Easements, Covenants and Servitudes,","A man owned land along the south side of a highway. To the south of the man's land was a lot owned by a woman who lived on it in a house. Five years ago the man conveyed a right-of-way easement over his land to the woman because it provided a more direct route between her house and the highway. The easement was evidenced by a clearly marked path. The document granting the easement was promptly recorded. Three years ago, the woman conveyed her house to the man. The man never took actual possession of the house. Two years ago, the man conveyed the house to a purchaser by a warranty deed. Two months after the purchaser moved into the house, a neighbor informed him about the easement. He then began using the path that had been marked on the man's land. When the man noticed the purchaser using the path, he erected a barricade on his land that effectively prevented the purchaser from using the path. The purchaser has sued the man, claiming that he has an easement over the man's land. Who is likely to prevail?","The man, because the easement was extinguished.","The man, because the purchaser did not have actual notice of the easement at the time of acquisition.","The purchaser, because he purchased the house by warranty deed.","The purchaser, because the easement was of public record when he acquired the house."
d,"Constitutional Law, Powers,","A mineral is added to bodies of fresh water to prevent the spread of certain freshwater parasites. The presence of those parasites threatens the health of the organisms living in rivers and streams throughout the country and imperils the freshwater commercial fishing industry. The mineral is currently mined only in State A. In order to raise needed revenue, Congress recently enacted a statute providing for the imposition of a $100 tax on each ton of the mineral mined in the United States. Because it will raise the cost of the mineral, this tax is likely to reduce the amount of the mineral added to freshwater rivers and streams and, therefore, is likely to have an adverse effect on the interstate freshwater commercial fishing industry. A producer of the mineral has filed a lawsuit in federal court challenging this tax solely on constitutional grounds. Is this tax constitutional?","No, because only mineral producers in State A will pay the tax and, therefore, it is not uniform among the states and denies the mineral producers the equal protection of the laws.","No, because it is likely to have an adverse effect on the freshwater commercial fishing industry and Congress has a responsibility under the clause to protect, foster, and advance such interstate industries.","Yes, because the tax is a necessary and proper means of exercising federal authority over the navigable waters of the United States.","Yes, because the power of Congress to impose taxes is plenary, this tax does not contain any provisions extraneous to tax needs or purposes, and it is not barred by any prohibitory language in the Constitution."

A month later, the nephew executed an instrument in the proper form of a warranty deed purporting to convey the land to his fiancée. He delivered the deed to his fiancée, pointing out that the deed recited that it was given in exchange for ""$1 and other good and valuable consideration,"" and that to make it valid, his fiancée must pay him $1. The fiancée, impressed and grateful, did so. Together, they went to the recording office and recorded the deed. The fiancée assumed the woman's nephew had owned the land, and knew nothing about the nephew's dealing with the woman.

d,"Torts, Intentional Torts,","A man suffered a serious injury while participating in an impromptu basketball game at a public park. The injury occurred when the man and another player, on opposing teams, each tried to obtain possession of the ball when it rebounded from the backboard after a missed shot at the basket. During that encounter, the man was struck and injured by the other player's elbow. The man now seeks compensation from the other player. At the trial, evidence was introduced tending to prove that the game had been rough from the beginning, that elbows and knees had frequently been used to discourage interference by opposing players, and that the man had been one of those making liberal use of such tactics. In this action, will the man prevail?","Yes, if the other player intended to strike the man with his elbow.","Yes, if the other player intended to cause a harmful or offensive contact with the man.","No, because the man impliedly consented to rough play.","No, unless the other player intentionally used force that exceeded the man's consent."

The five-member, elected governing board of the newly created water district contains two persons who are members of racial minority groups. At its first meeting, the governing board of the water district adopted a rule unqualifiedly setting aside 25% of all positions on the staff of the water district and 25% of all contracts to be awarded by the water district to members of racial minority groups. The purpose of the rule was ""to help redress the historical discrimination against these groups in this country and to help them achieve economic parity with other groups in our society."" Assume that no federal statute applies. A suit by appropriate parties challenges the constitutionality of these set-asides. In this suit, the most appropriate ruling based on applicable United States Supreme Court precedent would be that the set-asides are","unconstitutional, because they would deny other potential employees or potential contractors the equal protection of the laws.","unconstitutional, because they would impermissibly impair the right to contract of other potential employees or potential contractors.","constitutional, because they would assure members of racial minority groups the equal protection of the laws.","constitutional, because the function and activities of the water district are of a proprietary nature rather than a governmental nature and, therefore, are not subject to the usual requirements of the Fourteenth Amendment."

The painter did not ask for any payment when the first barn was completely painted, but she demanded $4,000 after painting the second barn. Is the farmer obligated to make the $4,000 payment?","No, because the farmer has no duty under the contract to pay anything to the painter until all three barns have been painted.","No, because the painter waived her right, if any, to payment on a per-barn basis by failing to demand $2,000 upon completion of the first barn.","Yes, because the contract is divisible.","Yes, because the painter has substantially performed the entire contract."

Without identifying himself as a security guard, the security guard suddenly grabbed the customer's arm. The customer attempted to push the security guard away, and the security guard knocked the customer to the floor, causing injuries. The customer sued the discount store for battery on a theory of vicarious liability for the injuries caused by the security guard. The store filed an answer to the customer's complaint, asserting the affirmative defense of contributory negligence. The customer has moved to strike the affirmative defense. Traditional rules of contributory negligence apply. Should the trial court grant the customer's motion?","No, because contributory negligence is an affirmative defense to a cause of action based on vicarious liability.","No, because the customer should have known that his argument with the cashier might provoke an action by a security guard.","Yes, because contributory negligence is not a defense to battery.","Yes, because the customer did not know that he was pushing away someone who was employed as a security guard."

The man's executor distributed the estate under appropriate court order, and notified the woman that future real estate taxes on both lots were her responsibility to pay during her lifetime. Except for the statutes relating to probate and those relating to real estate taxes, there is no applicable statute. The woman failed to pay the real estate taxes due for both lots. To prevent a tax sale of the fee simple, the friend paid the taxes and demanded that the woman reimburse him for same. When the woman refused, the friend brought an appropriate action against a woman to recover the amount paid.

City Y's City Council has adopted a rule that requires any limousines serving the airport to charge only the rates authorized by the City Y City Council. A limousine service has a lucrative business transporting passengers between City Z and the airport in City Y, at much lower rates than those required by the City Y City Council. It transports passengers in interstate traffic only; it does not provide local service within City Y. The new rule adopted by the City Y City Council will require the limousine service to charge the same rates as limousines operating only in City Y.

A majority of the owners of existing rental housing in the city opposed the ordinance. They argued that it would dramatically decrease the number of low-income rental housing units because owners would be unable to raise rents enough to recoup the investment required to comply. Without denying these contentions, the city enacted the ordinance. A plaintiff who owns low-income rental housing has sued the city, claiming only that the ordinance is unconstitutional on its face.

The construction was authorized by a building permit, validly obtained under applicable statutes, ordinances, and regulations. Further, the construction was regularly inspected and passed as being in compliance with all building code requirements. The neighbor's lot remained vacant until six months ago, when she began excavation pursuant to a building permit authorizing the erection of an industrial building situated on her lot but with one wall along the boundary common with the man's lot. The excavation caused subsidence of a portion of the man's lot that resulted in injury to the man's building. The neighbor's excavation was not done negligently or with any malicious intent to injure. In the jurisdiction, the time to acquire title by adverse possession or rights by prescription is 10 years.

d,"Constitutional Law, Powers,","City, located in State A, is a center for businesses that assemble personal computers. Components for these computers are manufactured elsewhere in State A and in other states, then shipped to City, where the computers are assembled. An ordinance of City imposes a special license tax on all of the many companies engaged in the business of assembling computers in that city. The tax payable by each such company is a percentage of the company's gross receipts. The State A statute that authorizes municipalities to impose this license tax has a ""State A content"" provision. To comply with this provision of state law, the City license tax ordinance provides that the tax paid by any assembler of computers subject to this tax ordinance will be reduced by a percentage equal to the proportion of computer components manufactured in State A. An assembly company assembles computers in City and sells them from its offices in City to buyers throughout the United States. All of the components of its computers come from outside State A. Therefore, the assembly company must pay the City license tax in full without receiving any refund. Other City computer assemblers use components manufactured in State A in varying proportions and, therefore, are entitled to partial reductions of their City license tax payments. Following prescribed procedure, the assembly company brings an action in a proper court asking to have City's special license tax declared unconstitutional on the ground that it is inconsistent with the negative implications of the commerce clause. In this case, the court should rule","against the assembly company, because the tax falls only on companies residing in City and, therefore, does not discriminate against or otherwise adversely affect interstate commerce.","against the assembly company, because the commerce clause does not interfere with the right of a state to foster and support businesses located within its borders by encouraging its residents to purchase the products of those businesses.","for the assembly company, because any tax on a company engaged in interstate commerce, measured in whole or in part by its gross receipts, is a per se violation of the negative implications of the commerce clause.","for the assembly company, because the tax improperly discriminates against interstate commerce by treating in-state products more favorably than out-of-state products."

Because the apparel company's order was for a rush job, the parties included in their contract a liquidated damages clause, providing that the textile company would pay $5,000 for each day’s delivery after March 15. The technician was inexcusably five days late in repairing the textile company’s machine, and, as a result, the textile company was five days late in delivering the cloth to the apparel company.

The court hearing the appeal should hold that the requirement imposed by the city on the issuance of this building permit is","constitutional, because the burden was on the company to demonstrate that there was no rational relationship between this requirement and a legitimate governmental interest, and the company could not do so because the requirement is reasonably related to improving the lives of families and children residing in the city.","constitutional, because the burden was on the company to demonstrate that this requirement was not necessary to vindicate a compelling governmental interest, and the company could not do so on these facts.","unconstitutional, because the burden was on the city to demonstrate that this requirement was necessary to vindicate a compelling governmental interest, and the city failed to meet its burden under that standard.","unconstitutional, because the burden was on the city to demonstrate a rough proportionality between this requirement and the impact of the company's proposed action on the community, and the city failed to do so."
d,"Civil Procedure,","A mail clerk domiciled in State A slipped and fell on ice that had formed near the loading dock of the building in State B where the clerk's State B employer leased space for its headquarters. The building was owned and operated by a State C corporation. As a result of the fall, the clerk was injured and the employer's expensive computer he was carrying was badly damaged. The clerk sued the building owner for negligence in a federal district court in State B, seeking $100,000 in personal-injury damages. The employer has filed a timely motion to intervene, asserting an $80,000 negligence claim against the building owner for the damage to its computer. Is the court likely to grant the employer's motion to intervene?","No, because although the employer has an interest in the clerk's action, that interest is not likely to be impaired in the employer's absence.","No, because the clerk chose not to join the employer as a co-plaintiff in his action.","Yes, because the employer is an indispensable party.","Yes, because the employer's claim shares common questions of law and fact with the clerk's action."
a,"Evidence, Character,","At the defendant's murder trial, the defendant calls his first witness to testify that the defendant has a reputation in their community as a peaceable and truthful person.

c,"Constitutional Law, Powers,","A valid treaty between the United States and a foreign country provides for the elimination of all tariff barriers between the two countries. It authorizes the president of either country to issue a proclamation nullifying any state or local laws in that country that have the effect of impeding imports from the other country. The foreign country uses the metric system of measurement, and thus all goods produced there and exported to the United States are packaged in metric sizes, such as liters and kilograms. A law of a state in the United States requires all goods sold in that state to be packaged in traditional American sizes, such as quarts or pounds. Because the state law substantially impedes imports from the foreign country, the President of the United States has issued a proclamation nullifying the state law pursuant to the treaty. Is the President's proclamation valid?","No, because the Constitution vests in Congress the exclusive authority to specify binding legal standards for weights and measures, and the President therefore lacks constitutional authority for the proclamation.","No, because the principles of federalism embedded in the Constitution prohibit the President from taking action to invalidate a state law.","Yes, because it is authorized by a valid treaty of the United States and is not prohibited by any provision of the Constitution and, therefore, is the supreme law of the land.","Yes, because the President has inherent authority to nullify any state law that substantially impedes commerce between the United States and another country."
b,"Civil Procedure,","A plaintiff successfully wins a judgment for patent infringement in Federal District Court against a defendant. Judgment is entered on May 1. On May 28, the defendant files a renewed motion for judgment and a motion for new trial, claiming that the trial court improperly applied the standard for determining whether his device constituted patent infringement or a sufficient change or improvement. The court hears the motions on July 6, and denies both motions, entering a minute order reflecting denial of the motions. On July 7, the plaintiff mails out a Notice of Ruling on the motions, serving the defendant by mail. On August 1, the defendant appeals from the original judgment. The plaintiff then moves to dismiss the appeal as untimely. The Court of Appeal should:",Deny the motion to dismiss because the defendant’s negligence in filing his appeal is excusable.,Deny the motion to dismiss because the defendant timely filed his appeal.,Grant the motion to dismiss because the defendant’s neglect in filing his appeal is not excusable.,Grant the motion to dismiss because the defendant failed to timely file his appeal.
d,"Evidence, Judicial Notice,","In a federal civil trial, the plaintiff wishes to establish that, in a state court, the defendant had been convicted of fraud, a fact that the defendant denies.

d,"Real Property, Cotenancy and Landlord-Tenant,","A landlord orally leased a commercial building to a tenant for a 10-year term, which ended one year ago. At the beginning of the lease term, the tenant installed numerous appliances in the building as well as a large air-conditioning system. The tenant alone paid for these items; they were installed with the landlord's permission and were used for the tenant's commercial enterprise. At the end of the lease term, the tenant failed to vacate the premises in a timely manner and continued to pay rent while remaining in possession for another four months. Before vacating the building at the end of the fourth month, the tenant removed the appliances and the air-conditioning system that he had installed, causing no damage to the building. Was the removal by the tenant proper?","No, because he was a holdover tenant.","No, because the lease was oral.","Yes, because they were accessions.","Yes, because they were trade fixtures."
b,"Contracts, Common Law Contracts,","A man, age 60, who had no plans for early retirement, had worked for a company for 20 years as a managerial employee-at-will when he had a conversation with the company’s president about the man's post-retirement goal of extensive travel around the United States. A month later, the company handed the man a written, signed resolution of the company's Board of Directors stating that when and if the man should decide to retire, at his option, the company, in recognition of the man's past service, would pay him a $2,000-per-month lifetime pension. (The company had no regularized retirement plan for at-will employees.) Shortly thereafter, the man retired and immediately bought a $30,000 recreational vehicle for his planned travels. After receiving the promised $2,000 monthly pension from the company for six months, the man, now unemployable elsewhere, received a letter from the company, advising him that the pension would cease immediately because of recessionary budget constraints affecting in varying degrees all managerial salaries and retirement pensions. In a suit against the company for breach of contract, the man will probably","win, because he retired from the company as bargained-for consideration for the Board’s promise to him of a lifetime pension.","win, because he timed his decision to retire and to buy the recreational vehicle in reasonable reliance on the Board’s promise to him of a lifetime pension.","lose, because the Board’s promise to him of a lifetime pension was an unenforceable gift promise.","lose, because he had been an employee-at-will throughout his active service with the company."

The parent corporation does significant business throughout the United States, including in State A. The subsidiary conducts no business and has no employees or bank accounts in State A. The subsidiary manufactures its tires for the European market, but 2% of its tires are distributed in State A by the parent corporation. The subsidiary has moved to dismiss for lack of personal jurisdiction. Should the court grant the subsidiary's motion?","No, because 2% of the subsidiary's tires entered State A through the stream of commerce.","No, because of the general personal jurisdiction established over the parent corporation.","Yes, because the accident did not occur in the United States.","Yes, because the subsidiary lacks continuous, systematic, and substantial contacts with State A."
b,"Torts, Trespass/Nuisance,","A restaurant building was expanded into a vacant lot north of its original location. The contractor who was working on the restaurant expansion found that the north wall of the new structure needed extensive support, so anchor rods and concrete were added.

Although there was no impact on the surface of his land or on existing uses, the owner of the neighboring property has sued the restaurant owner for trespass. Which party is likely to prevail?","The neighboring property owner, because he should have been given notice of the intrusion before it occurred.","The neighboring property owner, because the restaurant intruded upon his property without permission.","The restaurant owner, because the decision to provide the additional support was reasonable.","The restaurant owner, because there was no disturbance of peaceful enjoyment of the neighboring property."
b,"Contracts, Common Law Contracts,","In exchange for a valid and sufficient consideration, a man orally promised a woman, who had no car and wanted a minivan, “to pay to anyone from whom you buy a minivan within the next six months the full purchase-price thereof.” Two months later, the woman bought a used minivan on credit from a company for $8,000.

However, while on the stand, the officer is unable to recall the exact words that the defendant used. The plaintiff proposes to refresh the officer's recollection with a police report written by a fellow officer who was also at the scene and wrote down the defendant's statement. The defendant has objected to the use of this report to refresh the testifying officer's memory. Should the court permit this use of the report?","No, because the report is hearsay not within any exception.","No, because the report was not written or adopted by this witness.","Yes, because the report fits the public record exception to the hearsay rule.","Yes, because the report may be used to refresh recollection without regard to its admissibility."
d,"Constitutional Law, Individual Rights,","A city owns and operates a large public auditorium. It leases the auditorium to any group that wishes to use it for a meeting, lecture, concert, or contest. Each user must post a damage deposit and pay rent, which is calculated only for the actual time the building is used by the lessee. Reservations are made on a first-come, first- served basis. A private organization that permits only males to serve in its highest offices rented the auditorium for its national convention. The organization planned to install its new officers at that convention. It broadly publicized the event, inviting members of the general public to attend the installation ceremony at the city auditorium. No statute or administrative rule prohibits the organization from restricting its highest offices to men. An appropriate plaintiff sues the private organization seeking to enjoin it from using the city auditorium for the installation of its new officers. The sole claim of the plaintiff is that the use of this auditorium by the organization for the installation ceremony is unconstitutional because the organization disqualifies women from serving in its highest offices. Will the plaintiff prevail?","Yes, because the Fourteenth Amendment prohibits such an organization from discriminating against women in any of its activities to which it has invited members of the general public.","Yes, because the organization's use of the city auditorium for this purpose subjects its conduct to the provisions of the Fourteenth Amendment.","No, because the freedom of association protected by the Fourteenth Amendment prohibits the city from interfering in any way with the organization's use of city facilities.","No, because this organization is not a state actor and, therefore, its activities are not subject to the provisions of the Fourteenth Amendment."

The owner has kept the lawns and trees on his land trimmed and neat. The neighbor ""lets nature take its course"" on her land. The result on the neighbor's land is a tangle of underbrush, fallen trees, and standing trees that are in danger of losing limbs. Many of the trees on the neighbor's land are near the owner's land. In the past, debris and large limbs have been blown from the neighbor's land onto the owner's land. By local standards, the neighbor's land is an eyesore that depresses market values of real property in the vicinity, but the condition of the neighbor's land violates no applicable laws or ordinances. The owner demanded that the neighbor keep the trees near the owner's land trimmed. The neighbor refused. The owner brought an appropriate action against the neighbor to require the neighbor to abate what the owner alleges to be a nuisance. In the lawsuit, the only issue is whether the condition of the neighbor's land constitutes a nuisance. The strongest argument that the owner can present is that the condition of the neighbor's land",has an adverse impact on real estate values.,poses a danger to the occupants of the owner's land.,violates community aesthetic standards.,cannot otherwise be challenged under any law or ordinance.

The evidence has established the following facts: The station advertised its sponsorship on the radio and in print, distributed free tickets to the concert, staffed the event with the station's interns to assist with crowd control, and provided a station disc jockey to serve as master of ceremonies. The master of ceremonies had the authority to stop or delay the performance at any time on the basis of any safety concern. The station knew or should have known that the band routinely used unlicensed, illegal fireworks in its performances. Should the court grant the radio station's motion for summary judgment?","No, because there is sufficient evidence of knowledge and control on the part of the station to impose on it a duty of care to audience members.","No, because under respondeat superior, the radio station is vicariously liable for the negligent actions of the band.","Yes, because it is the band and the nightclub owners who owed audience members a duty of care.","Yes, because the conduct of the band in setting off illegal fireworks was criminal and was a superseding cause as a matter of law."

At the present time, the full board is composed of seven male arbitrators and six female arbitrators. A female state employee, filed a sexual harassment grievance against her male supervisor and the state. The state's attorney exercised all of her five strikes to eliminate five of the female arbitrators. At the time she did so, the state's attorney stated that she struck the five female arbitrators solely because she believed women, as a group, would necessarily be biased in favor of another woman who was claiming sexual harassment. Counsel for the female plaintiff eliminated four males and one female arbitrator, all solely based on grounds of specific bias or conflicts of interest. As a result, the panel was all male. When the panel ruled against the plaintiff on the merits of her case, she filed an action in an appropriate state court, challenging the panel selection process as a gender-based denial of equal protection of the laws.

a,"Constitutional Law, Powers,","Under the authority of a federal voting rights statute, some states drew congressional districts in a manner calculated to increase the likelihood that members of historically disadvantaged minority racial groups would be elected.
